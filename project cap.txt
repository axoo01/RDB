ðŸš€ Proud to share my first personal project in my web development learning journey! ðŸš€

In my quest to learn website development, I took on the challenge of creating a clone of the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) website's homepage. This project was more than just coding for me; it was about understanding the essence of what makes a great website and bringing that to life line by line.

Recognizing the importance of both aesthetics and functionality in web design, I have a few suggestions that might further enhance the RDB website:

- **Interactive Map**: An interactive map of Rwanda showing key development projects, tourist attractions, and business hubs. Users can click on different regions to get more information.
-**Live Chat Support**: Implement a live chat feature where visitors can get instant support or answers to their queries about investment opportunities, tourism, etc.
-**Upcoming Events Calendar**: A calendar showcasing upcoming events, seminars, and workshops related to business and development in Rwanda.
- **Newsletter Signup **: Add a section where visitors can sign up for a newsletter to stay updated on the latest news and developments.


Working on this project has been an enriching experience. I believe in continuous improvement  and always open to new learning opportunities.
